          <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
          <p>
            CST student of British Columbia Institute of Technology, I recently
            graduated Data Communications and Internet-working. Throughout my
            studies, I had the opportunity to work with and learn from many
            great people. <br /><br />I am excited to learn new technology and
            further develop my skills as I continue to explore the world of
            technology. I drive to improve myself everyday so I can confidently
            say I am a software developer. <br /><br />Aside from programming, I
            am a passionate self-taught cook who loves to try new recipes from
            all over the world. I constantly want to improve and refine my
            palate. I also enjoy sports and play badminton weekly with friends.

              <p>
                TalkToVern is a business idea Loredana Bruni and Scott Carroll
                thought of and enlisted the help of students to design and
                create a web application to record user response to voice lines
                and upload it. The usser has the ability to replay their audio
                before uploading and download their uploaded work afterwards.
                The project was designed and created from the ground up with the
                help of a professor to guide us. <br /><br />
                The final product delivered took over
                <strong>800 hours</strong> of design work, development, testing
                and deployment from me and my team.

              <p>
                The project was split into two separate web application. We had
                a team of 4 work on the core app and another team of 4 work on
                the external app.<br /><br />
                The external app can be anything. We decided to make an online
                tank game that keeps track of user scores and has a leader
                board.<br /><br />
                For the core app, we are required to design and create a social
                media profile where users must register with an email with the
                option to change or recover forgotten password. Once signed in,
                the user can upload/change their profile image, update their
                name, update/add a bio and display "badges" which are earned
                from the external app. Additionally, the user can search for
                other users of the applications and add filters to search based
                on badges, within the bio and/or name. <br /><br />
                The core app must have an API key from the external apps to
                communication via API calls. The badge are achievements for
                using the external app. All the data must be store in a
                database. The site <strong>MUST</strong> be responsive and
                secured.

                application with more modern design for internal users of the
                company. The application does not have to be mobile friendly but
                must contain a login using the company email to access it. Once
                signed in, the user will see a dropdown menu of a list of
                customers. Selecting it will display all the rquired billing
                details and enable the option to export the data via Excel.

                Additionally, the user can also request to download music that
                is available on the server. The server also has the ability to
                broadcast music via multicasting and any client with the port
                number and ip address can join. Finally, the application must
                support 1 on 1 VOIP call. The program must be threaded and is
                able to access each feature one after another without issue.

                Boba Booze is a business idea I had with some friends when I was
                in highschool. It is not a legitimate business at the moment but
                I was inspired to make a website based on my ideas years ago. I
                wanted to create a cafe style setting where people could
                hangout, drink, talk and play board games.
